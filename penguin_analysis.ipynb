    "\n",
    "From the scatter plot, we can draw the following insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are differences in the length and depth of the bill depending on the species of the penguin. Some species of penguins have a long bill and a shallow depth, while others may have a deeper and shorter bill.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is no clear linear relationship between the length and depth of the bill. This means that as the length of the bill increases, it does not necessarily mean that the depth will also increase or decrease. However, a certain trend may be seen in certain species.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Also, there is variability in the length and depth of the bill within each species. This shows that there are slight differences between individuals even within the same species.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that the size and shape of the penguin's bill vary depending on the species, which may be a result of various ecological factors such as habitat and diet. More detailed analysis on this would require further ecological research.\n"
